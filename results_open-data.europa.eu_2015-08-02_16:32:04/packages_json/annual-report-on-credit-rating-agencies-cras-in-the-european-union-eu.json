The Report also outlines ESMA\u2019s supervisory work plan for this year.\r\n\r\nESMA has found that CRAs continue to progress in how they comply with the CRA Regulation, including improved internal transparency and disclosure to the market on credit rating activities as well as empowerment of the compliance function. However, ESMA considers that improvements are still necessary, notably in the following areas:\r\n\r\n\u2022 validation of rating methodologies, to ensure that a credit rating assessment is a comprehensive risk assessment leading to high quality ratings;\r\n\r\n\u2022 internal governance, ensuring the full independence of the internal review function and thereby reducing the risk of potential conflict of interest; and\r\n\r\n\u2022 robust IT systems to support the rating process, including information security controls and protection of confidential rating information.\r\n\r\nThese issues form the basis for much of ESMA\u2019s supervision activities as outlined in its 2014 work plan. This includes the completion of the two on-going supervisory reviews into CRAs\u2019 monitoring of structured finance ratings and into small and medium-sized CRAs. A new thematic investigation on how CRAs review and validate their rating methodologies will also be launched, as well as dedicated work on CRAs\u2019 IT systems and controls. Following the entry into force of the amended CRA Regulation in June 2013, ESMA will also complete a specific assessment on CRAs\u2019 compliance with the new regulatory requirements.",
